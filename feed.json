            "content_html": "<p>My usual approach to learn a new system involves learning about its history and how it came into existence. Today we are exploring the robust controllers used in the satellites.</p><h3 id=\"some-interesting-history\">Some Interesting History</h3>\n<p>Early satellites from the 1950s and 60s, such as Explorer 1 and Vanguard, relied on simple attitude control methods to keep the spacecraft stable and correctly aligned which was done often using passive stabilization through spin mechanics or basic magnetic torquers. These methods worked well for the lightweight spacecraft of that era, but as missions grew more complex, the need for better control systems increased.</p><p>Coming to the 1970s and 80s, we had scientific missions like Skylab, Viking, and Voyager needed precise pointing for imaging, communication, and navigation. This turned attention to closed-loop feedback control, which used reaction wheels, star trackers, and gyroscopes. Conventional control methods, such as PID loops, decoupled axis controllers, and gain-scheduled linear controllers, became standard in spacecraft Attitude and Orbit Control Systems (AOCS). These controllers worked well under normal conditions, but they had a significant drawback. As missions became more complex, spacecraft dynamics revealed strong couplings, flexible vibrations, actuator nonlinearities, and major uncertainties. Traditional controllers struggled to ensure stability or performance when the spacecraft deviated from established models.</p><p>By the 1980s, the limits of traditional control theory were clear with the rise of large flexible spacecraft, deployable structures, and highly accurate Earth-observing satellite constellations. This led to a focus on control methods aimed at not just improving performance but also maintaining stability in light of modeling errors, disturbances, and worst-case scenarios. Organizations like NASA and ESA began to test these methods on projects such as the Hubble Space Telescope, ENVISAT, and various technology demonstrations.</p><p>Leading this change was H∞ (H-infinity) control, a concept that rapidly evolved throughout the 1990s. Unlike controllers based on exact models, H∞ includes structured uncertainty, disturbance management, and worst-case scenario handling directly in the design. This approach is particularly useful for satellites facing environmental torques, shifting mass properties due to fuel burnoff, flexible solar arrays, or issues with reaction wheels. In the following decades, H∞ control, along with robust methods like μ-synthesis LQG/LTR and gain-scheduling with robustness margins, became critical elements in advanced AOCS design.</p><p>Today, as spacecraft grow larger, more agile, and increasingly autonomous—from mega-constellation satellites to interplanetary probes—it is required to make the AOCS robust to various operational conditions. They form the basis of AOCS design, allowing satellites to maintain stability and functionality amid the many uncertainties found in the challenging space environment.</p><p>In the following blog, I will show how H∞ control can be applied to a typical AOCS problem, demonstrating its ability to provide reliable closed-loop performance even with considerable model uncertainties and external disturbances.</p><hr>\n<h3 id=\"some-mathematics\">Some Mathematics</h3>\n<p>Here is some mathematical background that will come in handy.</p><h4 id=\"system-norms\">System Norms</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>$H_2$ Norm: Root mean square value of the output for white noise input.  </li>\n<li>$H_∞$ Norm: Worst-case energy amplification from input to output.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>$$ ||G(s)||_∞ = max_ω σ̄(G(jω)) $$\nwhere $σ̄ $ is the maximum singular value.  </p><h4 id=\"the-small-gain-theorem\">The Small Gain Theorem</h4>\n<p>A feedback system stays stable if:<br>$$ ||Δ(s)||_∞ · ||T(s)||_∞ &lt; 1  $$\nwhere $Δ$ represents uncertainty and $T$ is the complementary sensitivity.  </p><h4 id=\"mixed-sensitivity-problem\">Mixed Sensitivity Problem</h4>\n<p>The standard $H_∞$ problem minimizes:<br>$$\n||\n\\begin{matrix} \nW_p S ,\\\nW_u K S ,\\\nW_T T\n\\end{matrix}\n||_∞\n$$</p><p>where:  </p><p>$S$ = Sensitivity function $(I + GK)^{-1}$  </p><p>$T$ = Complementary sensitivity $I - S$  </p><p>$W_p$ = Performance weight  </p><p>$W_u$ = Control effort weight  </p><p>$W_T$ = Robustness weight  </p><hr>\n<h3 id=\"a-little-context\">A Little Context</h3>\n<p>Let’s design an Attitude and Orbit Control System (AOCS) for a large, flexible communication satellite (it has kind of large solar arrays!) in Geostationary Orbit (GEO). This application suits H∞ well due to the complex and high-fidelity dynamics. \nIn general, there are various modes of control in the AOCS for satellite, and generally, the kind of mode depends on what the actual objective of the particular mode. </p><h3 id=\"step-1-mathematical-modeling\">Step 1: Mathematical Modeling</h3>\n<h4 id=\"satellite-rigid-body-dynamics\">Satellite Rigid Body Dynamics</h4>\n<p>Let’s keep it simple and we have the usual torque-inertia equation:\n$$\nJω̇ + ω × Jω = τ_{ctrl} + τ_{dist}\n$$</p><p>where:</p><ul>\n<li>$J$ = Inertia tensor</li>\n<li>$ω$ = Angular velocity vector  </li>\n<li>$τ_{ctrl}$ = Control torque</li>\n<li>$τ_{dist}$ = Disturbance torque</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 id=\"flexible-mode-dynamics\">Flexible Mode Dynamics</h5>\n<p>The solar arrays are not rigid.

Well, the performance, control and uncertainty weights are described below.</p><ul>\n<li>Performance Weight ($W_p$): It is based on the tracking error, $e = θ_{ref} - θ$. It is high at low frequencies to ensure good tracking and decreases at high frequencies.</li>\n<li>Control Effort Weight ($W_u$): This is applied to the control signal u (wheel commands). It is low at low frequencies to permit control action and increases at high frequencies to stop the controller from triggering high-frequency unmodeled dynamics.</li>\n<li>Uncertainty Weight ($W_Δ$): This is used to handle the flexible mode uncertainty. We apply a high-pass filter shape that is small at low frequencies, where our model performs well, and large at high frequencies, where the model does not perform as well.\nAnd, finally as described above the controller gain $K(s)$ is synthesized by minimizing: $$\n||\n\\begin{matrix} \nW_p S ,\\\nW_u K S ,\\\nW_T T\n\\end{matrix}\n||_∞\n$$</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Minimizing this norm directly balances performance, control effort, and robustness.</p><hr>\n<h3 id=\"controller-design-process\">Controller Design Process</h3>\n<h4 id=\"state-space-representation\">State-Space Representation</h4>\n<p>The system can be represented in the state-space form as:</p><pre><code class=\"language-matlab\">% System matrices for n flexible modes\nA = [0         I         0         0;\n     -K_rigid  -D_rigid  -K_coup   0;\n     0         0         0         I;\n     -K_coup&#39;  0         -K_flex   -D_flex];\n     \nB = [0; I; 0; gamma&#39;];\nC = [I 0 0 0];  % Attitude measurement\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"step-1-system-identification\">Step 1: System Identification</h4>\n<h4 id=\"parameter-estimation\">Parameter Estimation</h4>\n<pre><code class=\"language-matlab\">% Nominal parameters\nJ_nom = diag([1000, 800, 1200]);  % kg·m²\nfreq_modes = [0.8, 2.5, 5.0];     % Hz\ndamping_ratio = 0.01;             % 1% damping\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"model-construction\">Model Construction</h4>\n<pre><code class=\"language-matlab\">% Build state-space model with flexible modes\nn_states = 2 + 2 * length(freq_modes);\n[A, B, C, D] = buildFlexibleSatelliteModel(J_nom, freq_modes, damping_ratio);\nsat_plant = ss(A, B, C, D);\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"step-2-weight-selection\">Step 2: Weight Selection</h4>\n<h5 id=\"performance-weight-w_p\">Performance Weight (W_p)</h5>\n<pre><code class=\"language-matlab\">s = tf(&#39;s&#39;);\nW_perf = 0.1 * (s/0.1 + 1)/(s/10 + 1);\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Recall, characteristics:</strong></p><ul>\n<li>High gain at low frequencies for good tracking</li>\n<li>Roll-off at high frequencies to avoid high-frequency noise amplification</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 id=\"control-effort-weight-w_u\">Control Effort Weight (W_u)</h5>\n<pre><code class=\"language-matlab\">W_control = 0.01 * (s/5 + 1)/(s/0.5 + 1);\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Recall, purpose:</strong> Penalize large control inputs to prevent actuator saturation</p><h5 id=\"robustness-weight-w_t\">Robustness Weight (W_T)</h5>\n<pre><code class=\"language-matlab\">W_robust = 0.3 * (s/1 + 1)/(s/10 + 1);\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Recall, role:</strong> Shape complementary sensitivity for robustness to high-frequency uncertainties</p><h4 id=\"step-3-generalized-plant-construction\">Step 3: Generalized Plant Construction</h4>\n<pre><code class=\"language-matlab\">systemnames = &#39;P W_perf W_control W_robust&#39;;\ninputvar = &#39;[w; u]&#39;;\noutputvar = &#39;[W_perf; W_control; W_robust; e]&#39;;\ninput_to_P = &#39;[u + w]&#39;;\ninput_to_W_perf = &#39;[e]&#39;;\ninput_to_W_control = &#39;[u]&#39;;\ninput_to_W_robust = &#39;[P]&#39;;\n\nP_gen = sysic;\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"step-4-h-infinity-synthesis\">Step 4: H-Infinity Synthesis</h4>\n<pre><code class=\"language-matlab\">[K, ~, gamma] = hinfsyn(P_gen, nmeas, ncont);\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Algorithm Steps:</strong></p><ol>\n<li>Solve two Riccati equations</li>\n<li>Check existence conditions</li>\n<li>Construct controller state-space matrices</li>\n<li>Verify achieved performance level $γ$</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"step-5-controller-reduction\">Step 5: Controller Reduction</h4>\n<pre><code class=\"language-matlab\">if order(K) &gt; 8\n    K_red = reduce(K, 8);  % Reduce to manageable order\nend\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-in-matlab\">Implementation in MATLAB</h3>\n<h4 id=\"complete-design-code-structure\">Complete Design Code Structure</h4>\n<pre><code class=\"language-matlab\">%% AOCS H-Infinity Design Pipeline\n% 1.

I’ll keep it lively, promise. </p><h2 id=\"a-deeper-history-from-newton-to-poincaré\">A Deeper History: From Newton to Poincaré</h2>\n<p>Sir Isaac Newton kicked things off in 1687 with his <em>Principia</em>, nailing the two-body problem but admitting the three-body version was a brain-buster. He derived the inverse-square law, leading to:</p><p>$$ \\ddot{\\vec{r}} = -G M \\frac{\\vec{r}}{r^3} $$</p><p>for central force, but adding a third body exploded the complexity. Enter Leonhard Euler in the 1760s, who found the collinear equilibrium points (what we’d call $L_1$, $L_2$, $L_3$) by solving the force balance:</p><p>$$ \\frac{m_1}{d_1^2} = \\frac{m_2}{d_2^2} + \\frac{m_1 + m_2}{D^2} $$</p><p>where $D$ is the primary separation, $d_1$ and $d_2$ distances. Joseph-Louis Lagrange in 1772 expanded this to equilateral points ($L_4$, $L_5$), proving stability for small mass ratios via perturbation theory.</p><p>Fast-forward to Henri Poincaré in the 1880s: Competing for King Oscar II’s prize, he accidentally birthed chaos theory by showing sensitive dependence on initial conditions. His Poincaré sections—plotting phase space intersections—revealed the tangled web of orbits. Unsung hero? Karl Sundman in 1912, who found a series solution converging too slowly for practicality:</p><p>$$ \\vec{r}(t) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n (t - t_0)^{n/3} $$</p><p>Useless for computation but theoretically cool. In the 20th century, numerical methods took over, thanks to computers. For satellites, this history matters because GNC relies on these foundations—Lagrange points for parking, Poincaré for understanding instability.</p><p>Entertaining detour: Imagine Newton at a party complaining about headaches, while Poincaré spikes the punch with chaos. By the 1960s, NASA used three-body approximations for Apollo, calculating lunar transfers with patched conics (two-body segments glued together).</p><h2 id=\"the-basics-what-is-the-three-body-problem-anyway\">The Basics: What <em>Is</em> the Three-Body Problem, Anyway?</h2>\n<p>Three bodies, mutual gravity—no holds barred. Positions $(\\vec{r}_1$, $\\vec{r}_2$, $\\vec{r}_3)$, masses $(m_1, m_2, m_3)$. The full equations:</p><p>$$ m_1 \\ddot{\\vec{r}}_1 = G m_1 m_2 \\frac{\\vec{r}_2 - \\vec{r}_1}{|\\vec{r}_2 -\\vec{r}_1|^3} + G m_1 m_3 \\frac{\\vec{r}_3 - \\vec{r}_1}{|\\vec{r}_3 - \\vec{r}_1|^3} $$</p><p>And cyclic for others. Reduce by barycenter frame, but nonlinearity persists.

In this article, we discuss how this natural process works in detail and how it inspired the creation of an algorithm for problem-solving and optimization.</p><h2 id=\"natural-evolution-survival-of-the-fittest\">Natural Evolution: Survival of the Fittest</h2>\n<p>In nature, evolution is the gradual process through which species change over time to adapt to their environment. The main idea behind evolution is natural selection, often called “survival of the fittest.”</p><p>Here’s how it works:</p><ul>\n<li><strong>Genetic Material (DNA):</strong> Every living organism has genes, which carry the information that defines its traits—like height, color, or behavior. These genes are stored in a long sequence of DNA.</li>\n<li><strong>Population:</strong> A group of individuals of the same species living together. Each individual has a unique set of genes.</li>\n<li><strong>Fitness:</strong> Not all individuals are equally fit to survive in their environment. Some have traits that help them thrive (like better camouflage or stronger muscles), while others may have traits that make life harder.</li>\n<li><strong>Reproduction:</strong> Individuals that are better suited to their environment (more “fit”) are more likely to survive and reproduce. Their offspring inherit the genes that made their parents successful.</li>\n<li><strong>Mutation and Variation:</strong> Occasionally, random mutations occur in the genes of individuals. These small, random changes introduce new traits. Most mutations might not be useful, but some can provide advantages, helping future generations survive even better.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"example-of-evolution-in-nature\">Example of Evolution in Nature</h3>\n<p>Let’s take an example of birds living on an island where food is scarce, and only birds with sharp, strong beaks can break open the tough seeds available:</p><ul>\n<li>Over time, birds with stronger beaks will survive better because they can eat more food.</li>\n<li>These strong-beaked birds will reproduce more often, passing on the “strong beak” trait to their offspring.</li>\n<li>Birds with weaker beaks will struggle to survive and may not reproduce as much.</li>\n<li>Over many generations, more birds in the population will have strong beaks, and the weak-beaked birds will eventually disappear.</li>\n<li>If a random mutation makes some birds’ beaks even stronger or sharper, that trait could spread if it offers an advantage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Through this process of selection, reproduction, and mutation, species evolve and adapt to their environments over time.</p><h2 id=\"how-this-inspired-genetic-algorithms\">How This Inspired Genetic Algorithms</h2>\n<p>The process of evolution in nature inspired scientists to create a problem-solving algorithm that mimics how species evolve to find the “best” solution over time. Here’s how the inspiration from nature was used:</p><ul>\n<li><strong>Genes and Chromosomes → Variables and Solutions:</strong> In a Genetic Algorithm, just like in nature, we represent each possible solution to a problem as a chromosome. This chromosome is made up of genes, each representing different variables or characteristics of the solution.</li>\n<li><strong>Fitness in Nature → Fitness Function in Algorithms:</strong> In nature, fitness is the ability to survive and reproduce. In a Genetic Algorithm, <em>fitness</em> is a measure of how good a solution is at solving the problem.</li>\n<li><strong>Selection in Nature → Selection in Algorithms:</strong> In evolution, only the fittest individuals survive and reproduce. In Genetic Algorithms, the fittest solutions (those with the best fitness scores) are selected to create new solutions.</li>\n<li><strong>Crossover in Nature → Crossover in Algorithms:</strong> In biology, reproduction combines the genes from two parents to create offspring with a mix of both parents’ traits. In Genetic Algorithms, <em>crossover</em> mimics this by combining two solutions to create a new one.</li>\n<li><strong>Mutation in Nature → Mutation in Algorithms:</strong> Just as random mutations in nature can introduce new traits, <em>mutation</em> in a Genetic Algorithm introduces small random changes to a solution. This ensures that new possibilities are explored, even if the current best solutions aren’t perfect.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The key advantage of using evolution as inspiration is that Genetic Algorithms don’t need to know the exact path to the best solution. They explore many possibilities and use random variation, just like evolution, to stumble upon better solutions. Over time, by applying selection and combination, these algorithms can find highly effective solutions to very complex problems.</p><h3 id=\"example-maximizing-a-non-linear-function\">Example: Maximizing a Non-Linear Function</h3>\n<p>Let’s say we want to maximize the function:</p><p>[ f(x) = x \\sin(10\\pi x) + 2 ]</p><p>where ( x ) is between 0 and 1.

            "content_html": "<h3 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h3>\n<p>Polynomial guidance is a common guidance technique, particularly for spacecraft applications in space technology. It involves representing a spacecraft’s trajectory—whether positional or angular—as a polynomial function of time, enabling smooth, predictable paths optimized for mission objectives like fuel efficiency, time minimization, or safety constraints (e.g., avoiding debris or ensuring soft landings). Polynomials are favored because they are mathematically simple, infinitely differentiable (yielding closed-form expressions for velocity, acceleration, and higher derivatives), and can exactly satisfy a finite number of boundary conditions with sufficient degree. This makes them ideal for resource-constrained spacecraft systems requiring low computational overhead.</p><p>In spacecraft navigation, polynomial guidance is used for tasks like orbital rendezvous, planetary landing, formation flying, and attitude control. For instance, during orbital rendezvous, polynomials approximate relative motion dynamics described by the Clohessy-Wiltshire (C-W) equations, ensuring precise alignment with minimal thrust. This article provides a comprehensive exploration of polynomial guidance.</p><h3 id=\"so-how-exactly-polynomial-guidance-works\">So How Exactly Polynomial Guidance Works?</h3>\n<p>Polynomial guidance models a spacecraft’s state (position or angle) as a polynomial of degree $n$:</p><p>$$\nf(t) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k t^k = a_n t^n + a_{n-1} t^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_1 t + a_0\n$$</p><p>The degree $n$ is chosen based on the number of constraints: for $m$ boundary conditions (e.g., initial and final positions, velocities, accelerations), $n \\geq m-1$. Coefficients $a_k$ are determined to satisfy these constraints and optimize a cost function, such as minimizing fuel via the integral of acceleration squared:</p><p>$$\nJ = \\int_0^T | f’’(t) |^2 , dt\n$$</p><p>Polynomials are advantageous because their derivatives (velocity $f’(t)$, acceleration $f’’(t)$, jerk $f’’’(t)$) are lower-degree polynomials, simplifying analysis and control. For example, a 2nd-degree polynomial models parabolic arcs under constant acceleration, but spacecraft applications often require 3rd- to 5th-degree polynomials for complex orbits or attitude maneuvers. Benefits include closed-form solutions, computational efficiency, and adaptability to linear approximations of nonlinear dynamics like orbital motion.</p><h3 id=\"boundary-conditions-and-coefficient-determination\">Boundary Conditions and Coefficient Determination</h3>\n<p>To ensure a trajectory meets mission requirements, boundary conditions are imposed on $f(t)$ and its derivatives. Below, we derive coefficients for a 3rd-degree polynomial, suitable for matching initial and final positions and velocities, common in rendezvous or docking.</p><h4 id=\"3rd-degree-polynomial\">3rd-Degree Polynomial</h4>\n<p>The polynomial and its derivatives are:</p><p>$$\nf(t) = a t^3 + b t^2 + c t + d\n$$</p><p>$$\nf’(t) = 3a t^2 + 2b t + c\n$$</p><p>$$\nf’’(t) = 6a t + 2b\n$$</p><p>Boundary conditions at $t=0$ and $t=T$:</p><ol>\n<li><p>$f(0) = p_0$ → $d = p_0$</p></li>\n<li><p>$f’(0) = v_0$ → $c = v_0$</p></li>\n<li><p>$f(T) = p_T$ → $a T^3 + b T^2 + v_0 T + p_0 = p_T$</p></li>\n<li><p>$f’(T) = v_T$ → $3a T^2 + 2b T + v_0 = v_T$</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Solving the system from equations 3 and 4:</p><p>Let $\\Delta p = p_T - p_0$.

Optimization algorithms like quadratic programming or gradient descent are used, often in real-time for adaptive guidance. In spacecraft, the polynomial is fed into the GNC system, computing desired states ($f(t)$, $f’(t)$) at each timestep, with feedback controllers (e.g., PID) adjusting thrusters or reaction wheels based on sensor data. For multi-dimensional cases, separate polynomials per axis are used, coupled if dynamics (e.g., C-W equations) require.</p><h3 id=\"some-cool-examples\">Some Cool Examples</h3>\n<p>Below are five examples with computed coefficients, tables, and plots.</p><h4 id=\"scenario-1-simplified-1d-orbital-approach\">Scenario 1: Simplified 1D Orbital Approach</h4>\n<p><strong>Scenario</strong>: A spacecraft in low Earth orbit (LEO) drifts 10 km radially, needing to close to 0 km over 200 s with initial velocity -50 m/s and final velocity 0 m/s for a soft approach.</p><p><strong>Boundary Conditions</strong>:</p><ul>\n<li>$p_0 = 10000$ m, $v_0 = -50$ m/s</li>\n<li>$p_T = 0$ m, $v_T = 0$ m/s</li>\n<li>$T = 200$ s</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Coefficients</strong>:</p><p>$$\na = \\frac{2(10000 -
